Type 2 diabetes is a new health condition all over the world with rising trends and very significant implications if left untreated. The majority of the patients are unaware of their risk factors until the condition arises, and they are given delayed diagnosis and treatment. The traditional screening methods are usually not a comprehensive evaluation of the risk factors and therefore contribute some limitations towards early detection and preventive interventions. The lack of personalized, data-based predictive models makes appropriate assessment and prevention of risk for diabetes in patients and health care professionals challenging. Furthermore, significant risk factors such as age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking, obesity, and gender difference are often not taken into account with classic risk assessment methods.

The aim of developing the Diabetic Prediction Model is to provide an advanced, data-driven tool that can predict a patient's likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes with high precision. By applying various risk factors such as age, blood pressure, history of heart disease, smoking status, BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels, the model aims to deliver a composite risk assessment. Additionally, the model considers gender differences, particularly in women with previous gestational diabetes. This gender-specific assessment permits the early identification of those at risk, making it possible for them to proactively prevent or manage diabetes better.

By developing the Diabetic Prediction Model, people will know a lot about their risk of having diabetes and therefore be able to make informed decisions regarding their health and lifestyle. Early detection of the risk facilitates early intervention via lifestyle modification, medical guidance, and preventive therapy, reducing complications of diabetes. Physicians and medical professionals can also utilize the application of such a predictive model in screening their patients, enhancing early diagnosis and best treatment outcomes. In conclusion, the implementation at a high level of such a prediction model can assist in reducing the health system's economic burden due to diabetes, enhance public health in terms of quality outcomes, and enhance the quality of life among vulnerable subjects.
